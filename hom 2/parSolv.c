      - the last ghost point on p = P-1 holds u(1).
   Hence, all local vectors hold I elements while u has I+2 elements.

/* Instead of using gather (which may lead to excessive memory requirements
   on the master process) each process will write its own data portion. This
   introduces a sequentialization: the hard disk can only write (efficiently)
   sequentially. Therefore, we use the following strategy:
   1. The master process writes its portion. (file creation)
   2. The master sends a signal to process 1 to start writing.
   3. Process p waites for the signal from process p-1 to arrive.
   4. Process p writes its portion to disk. (append to file)
   5. process p sends the signal to process p+1 (if it exists).
